## Description
###### My project is an accordian style selection of Generation 1 starter Pokemon. When the user clicks on one of the listed Pokemon, the panel below the listed Pokemon expands to reveal the description and a small piece of information on evolution. When the user clicks on the listed Pokemon again, the content becomes hidden. The Pokemond pictured under the description is made to appear with an API call in Javascript.
