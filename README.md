## Description & Features

My project is an accordion style user interface. The user can make a selection of a Generation 1 starter Pokemon on any accordion panel. When the user clicks on one of the listed Pokemon, the panel expands to reveal the description and a small piece of information on evolution.

When the user clicks on the listed Pokemon again, the content becomes hidden. The Pokemon pictured under the description is made to appear with a fetch from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone the repository and open the code in your preferred text editor.
* Find the index.html file in your respective folder and open it in your preferred browser. 

## Goals
In the future, I would like to improve this project by...
* Adding separate accordions with more pokemon from other generations, with some added functionality.
